# HellDivers2_stratagem_macros

I have coded out a few stratagems so far as I don't need the full set. I may come back later to add more
It was tricky to figure out how to get HellDivers 2 to recognize the keystrokes.

My stratagem key is bound to end key and I use the arrow keys for inputs.  
If you wish to customize you can find the Virtual-Key Codes list in notes.

icons and bat files included.  some of the images seem dated, pulled from 3rd party

I will likely come back and do more cleanup at some point.

ie. set up the script's logic more efficiently, remove the logger I was using to debug, and clean some of the other files.
