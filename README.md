# HellDivers2_stratagem_macros

It was a lil tricky to figure out how to get HellDivers 2 to recognize the keystrokes.

Syntax is: python <path>stratagem_macro.py <Stratagem Name>

These are intended to be used as separate bats and linked to a hotkey or stream deck.  I use a free app that turns my phone and/or tablet into a stream deck.  Touch Portal, pro version very affordable also. https://www.touch-portal.com/

I have included a script to create the bat files for you. bat_creator.py
You will need to change the paths to your python executable and the directory that you have this script set up in the run bat_creator.py

My stratagem key is bound to end key and I use the arrow keys for inputs.  
If you wish to customize you will have to edit those in the stratagem_macro.py.
lines between lines 57 and 63 you can find the Virtual-Key Codes list in Notes Directory or at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes.
