These are intended to be used as separate bats and linked to a hotkey or stream deck.  I use a free app that turns my phone and/or tablet into a stream deck.  Touch Portal, pro version very affordable also. https://www.touch-portal.com/
I also noticed that touch portal hides the bat terminal from appearing.

I have included a script to create the bat files for you. bat_creator.py
You will need to change the paths to your python executable and the directory that you have this script set up in the run bat_creator.py

My stratagem key is bound to end key and I use the arrow keys for inputs.  
If you wish to customize you will have to edit those in the stratagem_macro.py.
